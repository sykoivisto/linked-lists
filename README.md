# Linked Lists

## Description

This was a quick javascript exercise. I'm learning more about computer science- algorithms, data structures. For this project I'm putting some knowledge to practice by creating a basic data structure with a javascript function; a linked list.

## Usage

linked-list.js contains the LinkedList factory, which has several methods:

```append(value)``` adds a new node containing value to the end of the list  
```prepend(value)``` adds a new node containing value to the start of the list  
```size``` returns the total number of nodes in the list
```head``` returns   the first node in the list  
```tail``` returns the last node in the list  
```at(index)``` returns the node at the given index  
```pop``` removes the last element from the list  
```contains(value)``` returns true if value is in the list and otherwise returns false.  
```find(value)``` returns the index of the node containing value, or null if not found.  
```toString``` prints out the LinkedList as a string formatted such as:  
```( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value )```
